Papaya: Utilities for Java 1.8+
===============================

Requires JDK 1.8 or higher.  All source code in this project is encoded
as UTF-8.  Many of the tests make use of East Asian characters
(Japanese, Chinese, etc.), so a font capable of displaying this test
data may be necessary to read and edit the source code.
